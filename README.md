# Logisim CPUs
This repository serves as a hub for all of my bigger Logisim projects, mostly computers and CPUs.

## Using a circuit
The projects were made on a linux computer, so the files usually have arbitrary extensions. **Everything is a simple '.txt' file** with the exception of the '.circ' Logisim files, and the extensionless assembler files, which need a '.py' extension on Windows.

These assembler files were written in Python 3, so they will **not work** without it. To compile a file, supply it as the first argument to the assembler.
